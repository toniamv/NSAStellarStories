# The Secrets of Space Weather

A playful, visual, and interactive educational game that introduces “space weather” to kids and teens—connecting science and imagination.

---

## Summary

Our project, “The Secrets of Space Weather,” teaches space weather concepts (such as solar flares, CMEs, radiation storms, and their effects on Earth) through a fun, accessible game. To address low awareness among young audiences, we use short, gamified missions that turn abstract scientific data into practical, relatable experiences.  
The project bridges science and education, fostering curiosity and promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

## Challenge

**Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings (NASA Space Apps)**  
Although the Sun is millions of kilometers away, its activity can impact technology and daily life on Earth and in space. The challenge is to write and illustrate a digital story that explains space weather and its impacts on different audiences (pilots, astronauts, farmers, grid operators, etc.), either from the perspective of affected people or from a solar phenomenon itself (e.g., a solar flare).

## Project Details

### Narrative

The story follows **Luma**, a curious, science-loving girl guided by her scientist friend **Dr. Brall**. Across three phases, Luma meets people affected by space weather—a pilot facing signal loss, a photographer chasing auroras, and astronauts exposed to solar radiation—and she also meets **the personified phenomena** themselves (like a Solar Flare and a Radiation Storm), which explain their origins and behaviors.

Each encounter brings **playful dialogues** that translate concepts into easy comparisons and **thematic mini-games** that reinforce learning in a fun way.

### Unique Features

- **Personification of solar events:** gives phenomena memorable personalities and creates an emotional bond with scientific ideas.  
- **Active learning:** kids participate in the story and solve challenges, fostering critical thinking and curiosity.  
- **Dual nature of space weather:** shows both risks (radiation, interference) and beauty (auroras).

### Educational Potential

The game can be integrated into classrooms or informal learning environments as a **space weather literacy** tool, encouraging interest in astronomy, physics, and environmental awareness.

### Expansion (Roadmap)

The current release is a **pilot with three stages**, showcasing potential and scalability. Future stages may include:

- Grid operator mitigating **GICs** during **GMDs** to protect transformers.  
- Space traffic engineer maneuvering satellites to compensate for increased **atmospheric drag** driven by **CMEs** and **neutral density** expansion.  
- Farmer stabilizing **GNSS** for precise planting despite **ionospheric scintillation** during a geomagnetic storm.

These scenarios highlight the diverse real-world impacts of space weather.
